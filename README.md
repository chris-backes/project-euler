# Solutions to Project Euler problems

Each of the javascript files contains a solution to one of the problems (indicated by the file name).

There is an index.html file so I can check the console and use DevTools if I need to.

Problems can be found at projecteuler.net.

## Multiple of 3 or 5

```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

Solution: iterate through the numbers between 1 and 1000, store the ones divisible by three or five in an array. Sum the contents of that array

## Even Fibonacci Numbers

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

Solution: we first run a while loop begining at 1, at verify if the number is divisible by two (and for reasons explained later on, less than four million). If it is, then we add that to our variable (fib) which sums the even values.
The trick with this sequence to to iterate the loop in two different pseudo loops contianed within the loop. The conditional checking for evenness runs twice, first on i, then on j, and after the check on i, i is set to the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
Then, the second conditional check the same qualities in j, logs the evens, and sets to the next number of the Fibonacci sequence.

We set to the next value in the sequence by seting either i or j to sum of i and j, and the one set is the one that was just check for evenness.

The while loop ends when both i and j are above four million. If we set it to either rather than both, there is a scenario where one is above the that and the other is both below that and even, and *would not get logged since the while loop would have stopped*. To prevent that, we set to both, and have each if conditional check for being less than the limit as well.

There is also an array in this script that does not perform any task related to the goal of this exercise, but it does log the evens so I can verify it is working correctly.

## Largest Prime Factor

```
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```

Solution: We check each number i between 1 and half the number num (here, 600851475143) to verify whether num is divisible by i. Since the is never any number such that it is divisble by any number greater than its own half (except for itself)--and, since this number in particular is odd, that would be any number greater than a third of itself--we do not need to chekc those numbers.

## Largest Palindrome Product

```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

Solution: For this we have two loops, one contained within another. The outer one starts with two variables i and j, and multiplies those together, checks to see if the reverse of the product is equal to the product, and logs if it is.

The second starts right after that, checking for the same, and iterates by subtracting 1 from j. One that second loop closes, j is reset to 999, and the loop iterates by subtracting 1 from i.

## Smallest Multiple

Under Construction

## Sum Square Difference

```
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

Solution: we have two different four loops. 

The one in which we need to square the numbers, and then sum those up, has two variable declared. One squares the number currently being iterated. The other stores the sums of those.

The one in which we need to add the numbers up before squaring has one variable declared to store the values as they are added during the loop. After that ends. they are squared.

The former is subtracted from the latter.

## 10001st Prime

```
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

Solution: This one assumes the first three primes to streamline the code. A while loop iterates starting at 7 iterates by 2 (there is only one prime number that is even, so we do not need to add one each time). Inside that is a while loop that starts at 2 (although we could just as well start at 3), and checks to see if any of the numbers up to a third of the possible prime are divisors (there is no odd number divisible by any number greater than its own third, except when that divisor is itself). We iterate by one, but we could iterate by two if we start at 3 (no odd number is the product of an even number and any other number). We would also have to assume 7 as a prime if we did that however.

The while loop ends when an array storing all of the primes reaches a specified length, and there is a console log of the last prime added.

## Largest Product in a Series

```
The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.

Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?
```

Solution: We store the number, then convert it to an array. A while loop that iterates from the number of digits minus the amount of numbers multiplied. Each iteration multiplies 13 consecutive members of the array (array[i] * array[i+1]...), and the product is stored in an array.

Once the loop is finished, the array storing all the products is sorted from least to greatest, and the last one is logged.
